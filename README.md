# AQUASOLVE


Creating a web application that empowers the public to capture photos of water-related concerns such as drainage problems or waterlogging. Users can upload these images in the app, accompanied by geo-tagging, and provide a detailed description of the issue through a designated form. The app will then display these pictures on a map, enabling relevant authorities to address and resolve the identified problems. Additionally, users will receive updates on the status of the issues they've reported.
